      <h2 style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Charlemagne Std ">Why I like basketball</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 10px">
I like basketball because it is a very fun sport. There is one thing I really want to do and that thing is dunking, but I can't because I am a little short.

      <h2 style="font-size: 10px; font-family: Charlemagne Std ">My 2011-2012 basketball season</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 10px">
I played in a basketball league this year for "Wolfpack" and our coach was Coach K. We practiced at the First Redeemer Church once a week. Our team went undefeated except that we tied in one game. Then we went to the playoffs and lost in our first game. It was a bad loss. I wish we had played better. It was great season and I enjoyed a lot.
