    Let me tell you a little about my self.</font> I love to play basket ball. 
    I also love to program. I am learning how to program from an awesome website 
    called <a href= "http://www.codeacademy.com" target= "_blank">CodeAcademy</a> 
    and I practice at <a href="http://labs.codeacademy.com" target= "_blank">Labs at Code Academy</a>.
    I am learning two different programming languages, <strong>HTML</strong> and <em>Javascript</em>. HTML
    is used to create pages for websites and Javascript can be used to create interactions.

Yesterday I made an HTML website(This one) and I wanted to save it some were so I went to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">  Githup. </a>
It is like a online USB because you put your code there to store it.You have to go through a number of complcaited steps to set it up.
My dad helped me set it up by doing some magic.
