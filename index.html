    Let me tell you a little about my self.</font> I love to play basket ball. 
    I also love to program. I am learning how to program from an awesome website 
    called <a href= "http://www.codeacademy.com" target= "_blank">CodeAcademy</a> 
    and I practice at <a href="http://labs.codeacademy.com" target= "_blank">Labs at Code Academy</a>.
    I am learning two different programming languages, <strong>HTML</strong> and <em>Javascript</em>. HTML
    is used to create pages for websites and Javascript can be used to create interactions.
    </font>

Yesterday I made a website using HTML (this one) and I wanted to save it somewhere on the web.
So my dad helped me setup an account at <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github.</a>
It is like an online USB stick but huge. You put your code in there to store it. You have to go through a 
number of complicated steps to set it up at first. My dad helped me set it up by doing some magic. After the intial setup it is easy. Then I just edit it (as I am doing it right now).<bold>Hope you enjoy my website</bold>.

Today I found this awesome website were they have videos on how to do HTML(Hyprer Text Markup Language ),CSS(Cascading style sheet),and Javascript.
 It is called <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" target= "_blank">TeamTreeHouse</a>.Ufortunatly not all of it is free, but
 luckly the whole HTML course is free so you can create a website as good as mine is.
