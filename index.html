 <h3>This is my personal website where I will talk about myself.</h2>

    Let me tell you a little about myself. I love to play <a href="basketball.html" target="_blank">basketball</a>. I also love to program. I am learning how to program from an awesome website called <a href= "http://www.codeacademy.com" target= "_blank">CodeAcademy</a> and I practice at <a href="http://labs.codeacademy.com" target= "_blank">Labs at Code Academy</a>.
    I am learning two different programming languages, <strong>HTML</strong> and <em>Javascript</em>. HTML is used to create pages for websites and Javascript can be used to create interactions.
 </p>
 
  <p>
    Yesterday I made a website using HTML (this one) and I wanted to save it somewhere on the web. So my dad helped me setup an account at <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github.</a>
It is like an online USB stick but huge. You put your code in there to store it. You have to go through a number of complicated steps to set it up at first. My dad helped me set it up by doing some magic. After the intial setup it is easy. Then I just edit it (as I am doing it right now).

  Today I found this awesome website were they have videos on how to do HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading style sheet), and Javascript. It is called <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" target= "_blank">TeamTreeHouse</a>. Unfortunately, not all of it is free, but luckly that the whole HTML course is free and you can create a website as good as mine is.

  I found another really cool website <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/" target="_blank">HTMLDog</a> that teaches you CSS and HTML for free. It helped me a lot to do the awesome CSS on my webpage.

  I am thankful to these websites for the knowledge and help they provided me to learn programming.
